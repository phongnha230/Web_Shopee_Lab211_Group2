# Task: Fix Admin Dashboard Data Loading

## Context
User reports multiple issues with admin dashboard:
1. ❌ **Payments page empty** - "Chưa có dữ liệu thanh toán"
2. ❌ **Cannot add news** - "Tìm thấy liệu để hoặc mô tả"
3. ❌ **Only 1 order showing** - Should show all orders
4. ❌ **Data appears lost on server restart**

Backend is confirmed running and connected to MySQL successfully.

## Root Cause (Suspected)
- Admin pages not loading data from API on mount
- Using stale localStorage data
- Missing [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/orderStore.js#12-36) calls in admin components

## Checklist

### Verification
