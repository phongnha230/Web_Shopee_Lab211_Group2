# Task: Fix Missing Orders on Customer Orders Page

## Context
User reports that previous orders have disappeared and only the most recent order is showing. This indicates orders are not being properly loaded from the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Found:
1. **`CustomerOrdersPage` doesn't load orders from API** - No `useEffect` to call [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) on mount
2. **References non-existent function** - Code tries to use `fetchOrders` which doesn't exist in `orderStore`
3. **Only using localStorage** - Orders are only loaded from localStorage (which may have been cleared)

### How it should work:
- When `CustomerOrdersPage` mounts, it should call [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) to fetch all orders from MySQL database
- The store should update with fresh data from the database
- User should see all their historical orders

## Checklist

### Investigation
- [x] Check CustomerOrdersPage for order loading
- [x] Check orderStore implementation
- [x] Identify missing loadFromAPI call
- [x] Verify backend API endpoints exist

### Fix Implementation
- [ ] Add [loadFromAPI](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) to CustomerOrdersPage imports
- [ ] Add useEffect to call [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) on mount
- [ ] Remove reference to non-existent `fetchOrders`
- [ ] Test order loading from database

### Verification
- [ ] Verify all orders load from database
- [ ] Verify orders display correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple orders
