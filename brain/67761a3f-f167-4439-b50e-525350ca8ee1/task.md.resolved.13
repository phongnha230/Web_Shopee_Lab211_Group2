# Task: Fix Admin Dashboard Data Loading

## Context
User reports multiple issues with admin dashboard:
1. ❌ **Payments page empty** - "Chưa có dữ liệu thanh toán"
2. ❌ **Cannot add news** - "Tìm thấy liệu để hoặc mô tả"
3. ❌ **Only 1 order showing** - Should show all orders
4. ❌ **Data appears lost on server restart**

Backend is confirmed running and connected to MySQL successfully.

## Root Cause (Suspected)
- Admin pages not loading data from API on mount
- Using stale localStorage data
- Missing [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) calls in admin components

## Checklist

### Investigation
- [x] Check AdminDashboardPage for data loading - ✅ Found payments and users load, but orders/news/products don't
- [x] Check if payments page exists and loads data - ✅ Loads from API on tab switch
- [x] Check if news management page exists and loads data - ❌ Does NOT load from API
- [x] Verify payment store implementation - ✅ Working correctly
- [x] Verify news store implementation - ✅ Has loadFromAPI method

### Fix Implementation
- [x] Add loadOrders to AdminDashboardPage
- [x] Add loadNews to AdminDashboardPage
- [x] Add loadProducts to AdminDashboardPage
- [x] Update useEffect to call all load functions
- [x] Test data loading from database

### Verification
- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] All data will load from database on mount
- [x] Ready for user testing
