# Task: Restore Product Review Feature

## Context
User reports that the review feature is not working:
- Previously, after successful order payment, users could leave reviews
- Reviews should display on menu items showing:
  - Number of reviews (e.g., "1")
  - Average star rating
  - Individual review details when clicking on the product
- Currently, reviews are not showing up on products like "Trà sữa trân châu"

## Checklist

### Investigation
- [x] Check review store implementation - ✅ Properly implemented with [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) method
- [x] Check review controller (backend) - ✅ Backend endpoints working correctly
- [x] Check review routes (backend) - ✅ Routes are set up
- [x] Check how reviews are fetched and displayed on menu items - ❌ **ISSUE FOUND**: [MenuPage](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/pages/Product/MenuPage.jsx#6-47) doesn't call [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) on mount
- [x] Check product detail page review display - ✅ `ProductReviewsPage` correctly loads reviews
- [x] Verify review submission flow after order completion - ✅ `CustomerOrdersPage` loads reviews and allows rating
