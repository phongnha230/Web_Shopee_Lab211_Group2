# Task: Fix Database Persistence Issue

## Critical Problem
- Database is wiped clean every time server restarts
- All orders, payments, news, reviews are lost
- Only shows 1 order because it's the only one created since last restart
- Cannot add news items

## Root Cause (Suspected)
- Sequelize `sync({ force: true })` drops and recreates tables on every server start
- Should use `sync({ alter: true })` or just `sync()` to preserve data

## Checklist

### Investigation
- [ ] Check app.js or server entry point for Sequelize sync configuration
- [ ] Check database.js configuration
- [ ] Verify MySQL connection settings
- [ ] Check if database file exists and persists

### Fix Implementation
- [ ] Change `force: true` to `force: false` or remove it
- [ ] Consider using `alter: true` for development
- [ ] Ensure database credentials are correct
- [ ] Test data persistence after server restart

### Verification
- [ ] Create test data (order, news, review)
- [ ] Restart server
- [ ] Verify data still exists
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations
