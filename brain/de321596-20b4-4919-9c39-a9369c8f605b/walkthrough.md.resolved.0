# Fix for Missing Orders in "Đơn của tôi"

I have addressed the issue where paid orders were not appearing in the "My Orders" list.

## Changes Created

### Frontend Fix
- **Modified**: [CustomerOrdersPage.jsx](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/pages/Order/CustomerOrdersPage.jsx)
    - Removed the client-side filter `orders.filter((o) => o.customerName === customerName)`.
    - The page now correctly displays all orders returned by the backend (which are already securely filtered to the current user).

## Verification Results

### Manual Test Steps
Please perform the following steps to verify the fix:

1.  **Login** to the application as a customer.
2.  **Navigate** to "Đơn của tôi".
3.  **Verify** that your past orders are now visible.
4.  **Place a new order** (pay with VNPay or Cash).
5.  **Return** to "Đơn của tôi" and verify the new order appears immediately.
