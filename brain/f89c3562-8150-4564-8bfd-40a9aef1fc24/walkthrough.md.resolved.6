# Fix: Review Count Mismatch

I have resolved the issue where the product card showed review counts (e.g., "(3)"), but the details page said "0 đánh giá".

## The Cause

The issue was a "type mismatch":
-   The **URL** gives the ID as a text string (e.g., `"22"`).
-   The **Database** stores the ID as a number (e.g., `22`).
-   The code was looking for an exact match, so `"22"` was not equal to `22`, resulting in an empty list.

## The Fix

I updated [Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js) to ensure all IDs are converted to numbers before comparing.

```javascript
// Logic Updated:
const pid = Number(productId);
// Now checks: Number(r.product_id) === pid
```

## Verification

Please refresh the page and check again:
1.  Go to the **Menu** page. confirming the items show their star ratings (e.g., 3 reviews).
2.  Click "Xem chi tiết đánh giá".
3.  **Expected**: You should now see the list of reviews actually displayed, matching the count shown outside.
