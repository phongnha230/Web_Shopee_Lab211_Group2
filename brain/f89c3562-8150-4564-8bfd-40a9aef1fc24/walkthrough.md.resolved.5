# Fix: Missing Reviews & Edit State

I have fixed the issue where reviews were not showing up and the "Edit" button was not appearing because the data wasn't being loaded from the server.

## Changes

### 1. [Frontend/src/pages/Product/ProductReviewsPage.jsx](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/pages/Product/ProductReviewsPage.jsx)
-   Added `useEffect` to call [loadFromAPI(id)](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) when the page opens.
-   This ensures the review list is populated from the backend.

### 2. [Frontend/src/pages/Order/CustomerOrdersPage.jsx](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/pages/Order/CustomerOrdersPage.jsx)
-   Added `useEffect` to call [loadFromAPI()](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js#12-28) (fetch all) when the page opens.
-   This ensures the page knows which products the user has already reviewed, allowing it to display the "Sửa đánh giá" (Edit Review) button correctly.

## Verification

1.  **Check Product Reviews**:
    -   Go to a product page that you have reviewed (e.g., "Trà sữa trân châu").
    -   Click "Xem chi tiết đánh giá".
    -   **Expected**: You should now see your review listed (instead of "Chưa có đánh giá nào").

2.  **Check Edit Button**:
    -   Go to "Đơn của tôi".
    -   Find the item you reviewed.
    -   **Expected**: The button should now say "Sửa đánh giá" (Edit Review) instead of "Đánh giá".
