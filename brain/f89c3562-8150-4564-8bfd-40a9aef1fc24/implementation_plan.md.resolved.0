# Issue Description
The user cannot add news because:
1. The [newController.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/controllers/newController.js) fails to import `News` model correctly (trying to destructure from a function).
2. The [newRoutes.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/routes/newRoutes.js) file does not define the API endpoints for news operations (list, create, update, delete).

# Proposed Changes

## Backend
### Controllers
#### [MODIFY] [newController.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/controllers/newController.js)
- Fix model imports: Import `News` and `User` directly from their files.

### Routes
#### [MODIFY] [newRoutes.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/routes/newRoutes.js)
- Import `newController`
- Define DELETE, GET, POST, PUT routes mapping to controller methods.
- Add authentication middleware for write operations.

## Verification Plan
1. Restart backend (user might need to do this, or I can try to trigger it if I had control, but I'll assume hot reload or manual restart).
2. Since I cannot interact with the UI, I will verify by notifying the user to try adding news again. I can also try to `curl` the list endpoint to see if it returns 200 (if server is running).
