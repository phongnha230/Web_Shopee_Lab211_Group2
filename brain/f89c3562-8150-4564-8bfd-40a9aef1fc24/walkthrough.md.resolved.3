# Review Submission Fix

I have fixed the issue where users could not submit reviews. The problem was a mismatch between the variable names used in the Frontend and Backend.

## The Issue

-   **Frontend** ([reviewStore.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js)) was sending: `{ productId: 123, ... }`
-   **Backend** ([reviewController.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/controllers/reviewController.js) & [validationMiddleware.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/backend/middleware/validationMiddleware.js)) expected: `{ product_id: 123, ... }`

Because `product_id` was missing from the request body, the backend's validation layer rejected the request.

## The Fix

I updated [Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js](file:///c:/Users/HPPAVILION/Documents/Cusor/Cafe_app/my-app/Frontend/src/stores/reviewStore.js) to convert `productId` to `product_id` before sending it to the API.

```javascript
// BEFORE
const response = await reviewServices.create({ 
  productId, 
  // ...
});

// AFTER
const response = await reviewServices.create({ 
  product_id: productId, // Mapped correctly
  // ...
});
```

## Verification

Please verify the fix by:
1.  Logging in as a customer.
2.  Going to any product page.
3.  Clicking "Write a Review" (or similar button).
4.  Submitting a rating and comment.
5.  Confirming that the review appears successfully without error.
